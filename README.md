Tiny tools for OpenBSD - MIT License

Originally inspired by the Tiny Tools article, by Gerald J. Holzmann, with some useful shell tools for coding on Unix-like systems...

The article was severals years old (I. Software, jan/Feb 2016) and the code should be adapted to OpenBSD. But I tried to convert them: 

- nana (was num), e printing utility for your code
- fun (was fn), a function search utility
- var (was itok), a variable search utility

Hope you can find them somewhat useful. Have fun!
